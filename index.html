          ... If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills,
          here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the
          tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="completed">
            For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a
            button.
          </li>
          <li class="completed">
            Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of
            hardcoding them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending
            or descending order.
          </li>
          <li>
            When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win
            (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a
            draw).
          </li>
          <li>
            Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the
            move history list.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
