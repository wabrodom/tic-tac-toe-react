1. Complete the 5 ideas for improvements, guide from the turorial

- [x] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a - [x]message about the result being a draw).
